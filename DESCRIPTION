Description: 'seq_ttest' is a function that implements Abraham Waldâ€™s (1947)
      Sequential Probability Ratio Test (SPRT) for the test of a normal
      mean (difference) with unknown variance in R (R Core Team, 2018).
      It performs sequential t tests developed by Rushton (1950, 1952)
      and Hajnal (1961), based on the SPRT. Specifically, sprt.t.test
      performs one-sample, two-sample, and paired t tests for testing
      one- and two-sided hypotheses.
      The test is to be applied to the data during the sampling process,
      ideally after each observation. At any stage, it will return a
      decision to either continue sampling or terminate and accept one of
      the specified hypotheses. For more information on the SPRT t test,
      see Schnuerch & Erdfelder (2019).

Description: The 'seq_ttest' function implements Abraham Waldâ€™s (1947)
    Sequential Probability Ratio Test (SPRT) for the test of a normal mean
    (difference) with unknown variance in R (R Core Team, 2018).  It
    performs sequential t tests developed by Rushton (1950, 1952) and
    Hajnal (1961), based on the SPRT. Specifically, sprt.t.test performs
    one-sample, two-sample, and paired t tests for testing one- and
    two-sided hypotheses.  The test is to be applied to the data during
    the sampling process, ideally after each observation. At any stage, it
    will return a decision to either continue sampling or terminate and
    accept one of the specified hypotheses. For more information on the
    SPRT t test, see Schnuerch & Erdfelder (2019).

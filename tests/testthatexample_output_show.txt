     Sequential  Two Sample t-test 

data: x and y
test statistic:
 log-likelihood ratio = 2.19276, decision = continue sampling
SPRT thresholds:
 lower log(B) = -1.55814, upper log(A) = 2.77259
Log-Likelihood of the:
 alternative hypothesis = -3.20056
 null hypothesis = -5.39332
alternative hypothesis: true difference in means is not equal to 0.
specified effect size: Cohen's d = 0.8
degrees of freedome: df = 18
sample estimates:
 mean of group one = -0.13828 1.0506
 mean of group two = 1.0506
